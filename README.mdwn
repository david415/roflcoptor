# ROFLCopTor

ROFLCopTor aims to be an exhaustive Tor control port filter daemon written in golang.

# Introduction

The Tor control port exposes powerful functionality, much more authority than most
applications need when they talk to the Tor control port. In accordance with the
principal of least authority each software module would ideally have authority
over only the resources needed to perform it's tasks. Here in the context of ROFLCopTor,
we seek to illiminate excess authority from applications which utilize the Tor control port,
therefore they will not be in the debian-tor group or otherwise have access to the tor
control port UNIX domain socket or TCP listener. The only available access to the tor control
port being via ROFLCoptor which exposes a TCP listener and or a UNIX domain socket. Applications
can be allowed to authenticate with ROFLCoptor but this isn't necessary because the filtration
policy is applied based on the client application's exec path which is discovered by matching
the socket inode via the Linux proc filesystem.

# Usage

A simple usage:

```
./roflcoptor -help
Usage of ./roflcoptor:
   -config string
      configuration file
   -watch
      watch-mode of operation will default to unfiltered-allow policy
```

Normally watch-mode is only used when creating new filter rule sets.


# Configuration

Configure your /etc/tor/torrc with a control port listening on a UNIX domain socket:

```
ControlPort unix:/var/run/tor/control.socket GroupWritable
CookieAuthentication 0
```

You have the option to use systemd to manage the starting/stopping of roflcoptor.
Place the systemd unit file for roflcoptor daemon in /etc/systemd/system/roflcoptor.
It should look something like this:

```
[Unit]
Description=roflcoptor - onion router control port filtration daemon
After=tor.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=debian-tor
WorkingDirectory=/var/log/tor
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/roflcoptor -config /etc/roflcoptor/roflcoptor_config.json
```

Create the directory, /etc/roflcoptor, and /etc/roflcoptor/filters for the filter rule files.
The json configuration file, /etc/roflcoptor/roflcoptor_config.json should look like this:

```
{
    "FiltersPath" : "/etc/roflcoptor/filters",
    "TorControlNet" : "unix",
    "TorControlAddress" : "/var/run/tor/control",
    "Listeners" : [
	{
	    "Net" : "unix",
	    "Address" : "/tmp/roflcoptor.socket"
	},
	{
	    "Net" : "tcp",
	    "Address" : "127.0.0.1:9051"
	}
    ]
}
```

As you can see the filter rules directory is specified in the above config file.
The filters in this repo are to be installed in the above specified filters directory, /etc/roflcoptor/filters.
